# Simple hello world example
# Note: println() not yet implemented, so this just evaluates expressions

var greeting = "Hello, TotalScript!"
var version = 1

# Calculate something
var x = 10
var y = 20
var sum = x + y

# This program runs successfully but produces no output
# (Built-in functions like println() will be added in Phase 5)
sum
